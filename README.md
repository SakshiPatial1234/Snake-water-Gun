# Snake-water-Gun
Snake Water Gun is one of several people's well-known two-player games. It's a hand game where the player selects one of the three types randomly: serpent, water and sword. We'll be using python here to implement this game.  This project consists of constructing a game for a single player playing with the machine

Following are the rules of the game:

Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.
